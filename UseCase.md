## Objective:

To build a comprehensive real-time fraud detection system that analyzes and classifies financial transactions as genuine
or potentially fraudulent while ensuring data quality, governance, and observability.

## The solution will involve the following steps:

1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Processing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Deployment
6. Data Storage
7. Workflow Management
8. Monitoring and Alerting
9. Data Quality Management
10. Data Governance Compliance
11. Data Observability

## Key Components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Use Apache Kafka to ingest real-time transaction data from various sources, and validate data
   using schema validation tools like Avro.
2. **Data Processing**: Leverage Apache Spark to preprocess, clean, and standardize the transaction data while
   anonymizing personally identifiable information (PII) for data privacy compliance.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that help identify fraudulent transactions using enriched and cleaned
   data.
4. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using historical data to classify transactions as genuine or
   potentially fraudulent.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a real-time streaming environment using Apache Spark's MLlib or
   other compatible ML libraries.
6. **Data Storage**: Store the raw transaction data, preprocessed data, and prediction results in Delta Lake while
   enforcing data retention policies.
7. **Workflow Management**: Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate and automate the entire data pipeline.
8. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Develop a monitoring and alerting system using Prometheus and Grafana to notify relevant
   stakeholders when potential fraud is detected.
9. **Data Quality Management**: Validate, clean, and profile data throughout the pipeline using Apache Kafka, Apache
   Spark, and data profiling tools like Apache Griffin or Great Expectations.
10. **Data Governance Compliance**: Implement data cataloging, security measures, and data privacy compliance using
    encryption and authentication features in Apache Kafka and Apache Ranger.
11. **Data Observability**: Integrate monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting capabilities to maintain the health of
    the data pipeline using tools like Fluentd, Logstash, Apache Zipkin, and Jaeger.

By building this comprehensive real-time fraud detection and prevention system for financial transactions, you'll
showcase your expertise in big data technologies, data quality, data governance, and data observability while
demonstrating your ability to apply these concepts in the financial domain.
